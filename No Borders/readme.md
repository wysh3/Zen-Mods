**Get more screen, less clutter.** This mod for Zen Browser removes borders around tabs, giving you extra space for content and a cleaner browsing experience. Perfect for anyone who loves a minimalist, streamlined look. 

## 📌 Overview

Zen Browser’s default design includes borders around tabs for aesthetics, but some of us like it even simpler. This mod removes those borders, leaving you with a sleek, spacious interface that lets you focus on what’s important.
